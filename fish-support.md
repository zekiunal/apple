## 🐠 Understanding Your Fish

### Fish Stats

Each fish has four main stats:

**Hunger (0-100)**
- Higher = More hungry (100 = starving)
- Increases by 1 point per minute
- Feed fish to reduce hunger by 30 points

**Health (0-100)**
- Affected by tank cleanliness and overfeeding
- Low health = fish gets sick
- Use medicine to restore health (+20 points)

**Happiness (0-100)**
- Affected by hunger, health, and cleanliness
- Clean tanks boost happiness (+3 per fish)
- Higher happiness = better mood

**Level (1-99)**
- Gain XP by feeding fish
- Each level requires: Level × 10 XP
- Bonus XP when feeding during preferred hours

### Mood System

Fish display one of four moods (priority order):

**🤒 Sick (Red)**
- Health ≤ 50 or has disease
- **Action Required:** Use medicine immediately
- No XP gain while sick

**😋 Hungry (Yellow)**
- Hunger ≥ 70
- **Action Required:** Feed the fish
- Reduced XP gain when hungry

**😊 Happy (Green)**
- Happiness ≥ 70, Hunger ≤ 40, Health ≥ 80, Cleanliness ≥ 60
- **Optimal state:** Maximum XP gain
- Keep fish in this state for best results

**😐 Neutral (Gray)**
- All other conditions
- Normal XP gain

### Fish Species

Each species has unique traits and behaviors:

| Species | Traits | Active Hours | Hunger Rate |
|---------|--------|--------------|-------------|

## 🐣 Breeding System

### How Breeding Works

**Step 1: Alpha Female Selection**
- Tank must have cleanliness ≥ 75%
- Must have an adult female fish
- Female must be well-fed (fullness ≥ 80)
- No existing alpha or baby fish
- Automatic selection every second

**Step 2: Baby Spawns**
- 2 minutes (120 seconds) after alpha is selected
- Random species and gender
- Starts at 10% size (baby)
- Notification sent 🐣

**Step 3: Baby Growth**
- Grows 1% every 10 seconds
- **Growth Requirements:**
  - Health > 30
  - Fullness > 70 (hunger < 30)
  - Happiness > 50
- Becomes adult at 80% size (8 minutes if conditions met)
- Adult celebration notification sent 🎉

**Step 4: Alpha Resets**
- After baby spawns, alpha status is removed
- Leader following is disabled until baby becomes adult
- Cycle can repeat once baby is adult

### Breeding Tips

✅ **Keep females well-fed** (fullness 80+)
✅ **Maintain clean tank** (75%+ cleanliness)
✅ **Don't let babies starve** (they grow slower)
✅ **Wait for adult status** before breeding again
✅ **Max 5 adults per tank** (1 baby allowed simultaneously)

## 🏰 Multi-Tank System

### Unlocking New Tanks

**How to Create:**
1. Meet the 6-adult-fish requirement in all tanks
2. Swipe to Statistics View
3. Look for "Add Tank" option (appears automatically)

**Managing Multiple Tanks:**
- Swipe left/right in Aquarium View to switch tanks

## 🏪 Shop System

### Buying Supplies

**Food:**
- 5 Food = 10 coins
- 10 Food = 20 coins
- 25 Food = 50 coins

**Medicine:**

## 👑 Leadership System

### Male Leaders

- Male fish compete for leadership
- Leader is determined by **leadership score:**
  - `Score = (Level × 10) + Happiness + (100 - Hunger) + Health`
- Leadership changes dynamically as stats change
- Leader status is cosmetic (future feature potential)

### Alpha Females

- Only one alpha female per tank
- Selected automatically based on:
  - Female gender
  - Adult size (≥ 80%)
  - High fullness (≥ 80)
  - Best leadership score among females
- Alpha status enables breeding (2-minute timer)

---

## 💎 Idle & Offline Progression

### How It Works

When you close the app:
- Hunger continues to increase
- Tank cleanliness decreases
- Baby fish continue growing (if conditions met)
- Breeding timers continue

**Offline Calculation:**
- When you return, game calculates time elapsed
- Simulates hunger, growth, and decay
- Applies changes all at once
- Notification: "You were away for X hours"

**Important:**
- Fish can't die, but health/happiness will drop
- Babies may stop growing if conditions aren't met
- Returning to 100% hunger requires immediate feeding

## 📊 Advanced Tips & Strategies

### Maximize XP Gain

1. **Feed during active hours** for bonus XP
2. **Keep happiness high** (≥70) for optimal XP
3. **Level multiple fish evenly** for steady coin income
4. **Focus on low-hunger species** (Starfish, Seahorse) for easier management

### Efficient Resource Management

1. **Feed before leaving** to prevent starvation during offline time
2. **Clean regularly** to avoid health decay
3. **Buy food in bulk** (25 food = best coin-to-food ratio)
4. **Save medicine** for emergencies (don't use on minor health loss)

### Breeding Optimization

1. **Maintain 75%+ cleanliness** at all times
2. **Keep 2-3 adult females well-fed** for quick alpha selection
3. **Feed baby fish immediately** after spawning for fast growth
4. **Wait for 80% size** before breeding again

### Multi-Tank Expansion

1. **Fill primary tank first** (free fish vs. 10 coins each)
2. **Breed strategically** to reach 6 adults per tank
3. **Balance resources** across tanks
4. **Prioritize feeding babies** to unlock new tanks faster
